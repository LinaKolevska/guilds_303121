## The Question ⁉️:
Achievements, Qualities, Current Status: all features that determine the fate of these competing scholars. This brings us to the final, dire question:
### **Who will be worthy enough to ascend into the Master Guild of Magic?**


## Our Task 💭:
With competition at an all time high within the kingdom, a race to contribute the most to the technological development and progression of Marendor is in commencement. 

* Their paramount goal is to utilize their overall potential to reach the final, and most determinant level of wizardry: the *"Master Guild”.*

* Most scholars begin in the lowly phases of magic, with the heavy majority of scholars **not** belonging to any Guild; their Guild status is simple *“No Guild”.*

* A much smaller fraction of the remaining scholars, whom of which have not ascended into professional magic, have managed to get into the second-tier guild: the *“Apprentice Guild”.* Here, the scholars are in a preparatory phase to reach a Master Guild status. 

### Considering these three membership situations: we determined that the task at hand requires a: *multi-class classification approach.*



Commissioned by the King of Marendor, we were granted publicly-shared, personal details about these determined scholars. With this data, we trained the most efficient, top-of-the-line models following a thorough process of cleaning, balancing, and incrementally analyzing the supplied data. 

By collectively taking every feature, whether physiological attributes or magic-capability measurement, we determine the most effective methodologies/approaches to maximize predicting potential! Given the multitude of features to analyze from, we harnessed these strategies to hunt for the most relevant and useful features to accomplish this classification task.

## Project Preparation 🧮:
*In efforts to manipulate and assess the dataset to its greatest capacity, we employed a myriad of Python libraries, a majority of functions coming from Scikit-Learn, and many others from Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Missingno, PyPlot, SciPy, and we utilized Python modules like “time” and “collections”.


**Purpose of Libraries & Modules:**
- *Scikit-Learn:* offers tools for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. This library contains algorithms like SVMs, Random Forests, K-Means Clustering and has tools for evaluating our models and preprocessing the data.
- *Pandas:* integral for data manipulation and analysis and grants data structure like “DataFrame”, especially for tabular data. This helps clean data, aggregating/merging, and filtering and handling missing values.
- *NumPy:* used for numerical computing and working to support large arrays with multidimensions and matrices. This completes statistical computations and linear algebra, while manipulating data on a quantitative scale.
- *Seaborn:* to statistically visualize data (working with Matplotlib) to effectively develop and output aesthetic plots. We implemented this greatly for our correlation heatmaps, our box plots, and more for our EDA
- *Missingno:* mainly employed to visualize our missing values and comprehend the patterns of our missing data. This is imperative in cleaning and preparing our dataset.
- *PyPlot:* as a module of the Matplotlib library, we utilized this to create interactive visualizations to plot out graphs and add labels, all while customizing our conceptualizations. 
- *time module:* This module is built into Python but worth mentioning as it deals with time-related problems and operations. We employed this module to measure execution time and establish timestamps.
- *collections module:* This is also a built-in Python module and offers specialized manipulations of collections of data. It is able to enumerate frequencies with its Counter function and create ordered dictionaries.


*No monarchical projects go without meticulous preparation and pre-structuring, and thus, we configured a series of steps to complete our task.
